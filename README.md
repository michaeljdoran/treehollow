"He remembers those vanished years. 
As though looking through a dusty window pane, the past is something he could see, but not touch. 
And everything he sees is blurred and indistinct"

"In the old days, if someone had a secret they didn't want to share, they'd go up a mountain, find a tree, carve a hole in it, whisper the secret into the hole, then cover it with mud. 
That way, nobody else would ever discover it."
