            "In the old days, if someone had a secret they didn't want to share, they'd go up a
            mountain, find a tree, carve a hole in it, whisper the secret into the hole, then
            cover it with mud. That way, nobody else would ever discover it."

            This is a space for quiet release. A meditative vessel where you can give form to
            the thoughts weighing on your mind through words or drawings. Release them and watch them
            gently fade away into nothing.
        </p>

        <p>
            There is no saving, no permanence. What you create here exists only for a moment,
            then dissolves. Let it carry what you need to let go of, and allow yourself to
            simply be present as it disappears.

                Nothing you type or draw here is tracked, stored, or sent anywhere.
                Your thoughts exist only on your screen, then vanish completely.
